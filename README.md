# Pytorch Introductory Codes

In this repository, notebooks with examples for application Pytorch in deep learning modeling through neural networks are placed. They were developed during my PyTorch studies.

###### 1) **1_studyTorch**: Simple neural network illustrating parameter initialization, forward propagation and backpropagation. 
###### 2) **2_basic_example**: Pytorch dense neural network applied to Iris dataset for classification.
###### 3) **3_basic_example**: Extension of neural network applied to Iris dataset to use ReLU activation functions and negative log loss function as cost function.
###### 4) **4_basic_example**: Illustration of use of dataloarders and neural network defined as a class with dense layers and forward function. Estimation of precision and recall for assessing performance of model on Iris dataset.
###### 5) **5_DNN_Credit_Fraud**: Application of neural networks on Credit card default dataset. Example of the use of GPU and CUDA support to train neural network model. 
###### 6) **6_Image_Classification**: Application of neural network composed by dense layers on fruit image dataset for species classification.
###### 7) **7_CNN_Image_Classification**: Applciation of convolutional neural network architecture on fruit image dataset for species classification.
